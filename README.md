# Vehicle Simulator
This is a TypeScript based command line application that allows users to create, manage, and perform actions with various vehicle types. Initially designed for cars, this app has been forked and extended to support trucks and motorbikes using standard object oriented programming principles and the inquirer package for interactive input.

Since this is a command-line application and won't be deployed, you can view a [video walkthrough](...) that demonstrates its functionality.

## Features
This app supports Cars, Trucks, and Motorbikes, offering a variety of interactive features to enhance the user experience:

  #### Vehicle Creation: 
  * Users can create new vehicles by selecting from three options: Car, Truck, or Motorbike. The application will prompt the user for relevant details based on their vehicle choice 
  #### Vehicle Selection: 
  * Users can choose from a list of previously created vehicles, making it easy to interact with.
  #### Vehicle Actions: 
  * Once a vehicle is selected or created, users can perform a variety of actions (e.g. start, stop, accelerate vehicle) with prompts. 

Each action provides real time feedback in the command line, allowing users to see the result of their interaction.

## Installation

## Usage
#### How It Works

Once you've made your choice, you can perform various actions like starting, stopping, accelerating, or printing vehicle details. After each action, you'll return to the action menu to choose the next step, until you're ready to exit.

#### Use Cases
This application can be used for a variety of purposes, including as a vehicle management system, a vehicle simulator, a customization tool, or even for feature comparisons between different types of vehicles.
